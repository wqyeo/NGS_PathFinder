 # NGS PathFinding

This project was developed as part of a University project, with the aim of showcasing various pathfinding algorithms.

It focuses on implementing pathfinding functionality on top of an existing interactive map of "Phantasy Star Online: New Genesis" (PSO2: NGS), an open world MMORPG.

"Phantasy Star Online: New Genesis" provides players with an expansive game world filled with resources to collect. These resources are scattered throughout the game world, making it an ideal environment to demonstrate and compare different pathfinding algorithms.
